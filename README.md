# sortable-filterable-table
Table developed using javascript, combining both sortable and filtering functionality. Allows users to quickly search for what they're looking for on a table by being able to search by keyword or sort alphanumerically.

This was originally modeled off of the sortable/filterable tables that are common on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website, built using the resources available at W3Schools. An example is also uploaded to this repository so you can see how it works in practice.
